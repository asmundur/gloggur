# Glöggur
A symbol-level, incremental codebase indexer for semantic search and precedent retrieval.  Built to help coding agents answer “how is this usually done here?” using real code instead of inferred conventions. Supports change-aware indexing, semantic search, and docstring validation. Embedding backends are pluggable.
